# Smooth Talk Squad

### **Overview**

- Project title: Detecting Stuttering in Audio Files
- Authors: Satone Chin, Lizzie Murchison, and Weilin Lin
- Description: This project aims to detect stuttering in audio recordings using advanced AI techniques. Employing deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs, it swiftly identifies instances of stuttering in spoken sentences. Feedback and positive reinforcement are provided to users, fostering an environment conducive to improving verbal communication skills.
- Data Source: SEP-28k dataset available on Github. The dataset contains stuttering event annotations for approximately 28,000 3-second clips. (Lea, C., Mitra, V., Joshi, A., Kajarekar, S., & Bigham, J. P. (2021). SEP-28k: A Dataset for Stuttering Event Detection from Podcasts with People Who Stutter. Presented at ICASSP 2021.)
- Performance: The model can detect stuttering with 65% recall and 23% precision.

- This project was completed as part of the Le Wagon Tokyo Data Science course in March 2024 (Batch #1509). This model is for educational purposes only and should not be used as a diagnostic tool.

### About

Embark on a journey to empower children who stutter with a revolutionary game designed to enhance verbal communication skills. This interactive experience presents players with a series of challenges, requiring fluency in articulation to progress through missions seamlessly.

### **Technical Stack**

At the core of this innovative game lies a sophisticated stutter detection system, driven by artificial intelligence. Players are prompted to vocalize sentences, recorded for meticulous analysis. Leveraging deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, this system swiftly identifies signs of stuttering with precision.

In instances where no stammering is detected, players receive positive reinforcement and constructive feedback, nurturing a supportive environment for personal growth. This project showcases a seamless fusion of advanced technology and a user-centric approach, exemplifying the synergy between data science and societal impact.

### **Challenges**

One of the primary challenges encountered was the diverse range of sound patterns and behaviors encompassed within stuttering. For instance, stuttering encompasses physical responses that cannot be solely detected through audio analysis, posing a multifaceted obstacle to overcome.

### **Next Steps**

In summary, this project stands poised to revolutionize costly private stuttering speech therapy through technological innovation. Future endeavors will focus on real-life testing of the network to validate its generalization and feasibility in technology-assisted therapy, marking the next stride towards advancing accessibility and efficacy in speech therapy.
